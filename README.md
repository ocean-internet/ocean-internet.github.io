## About Me

I’m Andy Weir, a Technical Consultant specialising in software architecture, secure delivery, and engineering
effectiveness. I help organisations modernise platforms, improve flow, and build systems that scale, without losing
sight of outcomes.

I’ve spent 20+ years in software engineering across diverse industries, including healthtech, retail, travel, and oil
and gas. I help teams connect technical decisions to real business needs, working directly with the people who build and
run the software.

Outside work, you’ll find me racing a small yacht, paddle-boarding the Cornish coast, or reading something nerdy.

## Experience

In my current role, I help clients modernise legacy systems, streamline delivery processes, and build maintainable
software that supports their long-term goals.

- **Modernising Legacy Systems**\
  I’ve led projects to break down fragile monoliths into scalable microservices, using incremental migration patterns
  that reduce risk and maintain continuity.

- **Optimising Software Delivery**\
  I help teams improve feedback loops, automate quality gates, and reduce delivery friction — often introducing CI/CD
  practices that improve flow and reduce failure rates.

- **Aligning Engineering with Outcomes**\
  I work with developers, stakeholders, and leadership to clarify goals, prioritise technical investments, and build
  software that delivers lasting value.

## Approach

My work focuses on making engineering effective — not just technically sound, but also safe, scalable, and aligned with
business goals. I help teams modernise systems, simplify delivery, and build software that works in the real world.

- **Digital Transformation**\
  I support teams through high-stakes change — evolving architecture, addressing technical debt, and making systems
  easier to maintain, adapt, and scale.

- **Outcome-Driven Delivery**\
  My work focuses on outcomes, not outputs. I help teams identify what success looks like and adapt architecture,
  process, and practice to achieve it.

- **Deep Technical Foundations**\
  From backend APIs to deployment pipelines, I draw on broad technical experience and strong design principles to help
  teams build software that lasts.

## Personal Interests – Yacht Racing

I’m the owner and skipper of _Bad Habits_, a Hydro 28 yacht raced out of Flushing Sailing Club. Leading a crew of five,
I enjoy the competitive and strategic side of sailing — balancing teamwork, navigation, and technical skills. It
sharpens my decision-making both on and off the water.
